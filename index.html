            <p>
                Emmanuel "Manny" Rivera is a professional who started as a Pre Med major in Providence College after finishing highschool
                at St. Raymond's HS for Boys in the Bronx, NY - with a 4.0 GPA. After a year at Providence, Manny decided to come home and began his new 
                journey at Manhattan College with a brand new major, Computer Science. Manny graduated in 2010 with a BA in Computer Science.
                <br><br>
                Manny's work journey took him to Enterprise Rent a Car and then soon after to Target, where he became a Team Leader for the 
                Price Accuracy Team. Eventhough this was not in his major's field, he developed and groomed a leadership mentality and also was
                the SME for all technical support issues at Target.
                <br><br>
                In 2013, Manny moved from the Bronx, NY to Tampa, FL, where he began his tenure at Verizon Wireless. He began in Customer Service,
                transitioned to Tech Support and ultimately transitioned to Operations. In Operations, Manny was able to cultivate his passion 
                for technology through managing a gamification platform, running incentives, writing and delivering communications and caring for 
                employee incentive programs. 
                <br><br>
                Manny has since moved on to a new role and and is currently working for the Verizon Business Group, writing user stories for employee system 
                enhancements. He has also reccently started a Full Stack Bootcamp at the University of Central Florida to hone his skills and get back
                to his Computer Science roots.
                <br><br> 
                In his free time, Manny enjoys recording music, watching movies, Universal Studios Orlando, Yankees baseball, collecting sneakers and 
                all things Puerto Rico and the Bronx, NY. Manny lives in Lakeland, FL with his fianc&#233 and his 11 year old stepdaughter.
